    The African elephant (Loxodonta) is a genus comprising two living elephant species, the African bush elephant<br> 
    (L. africana) and the smaller African forest elephant (L. cyclotis). Both are herbivores and live in groups. They<br> 
    have grey skin and differ in the size of their ears and tusks, and in the shape and size of their skulls.Both species<br> 
    are listed as Vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List since 2004, and are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation.<br> 
    Poaching for the illegal ivory trade is a threat in several range countries as well.Loxodonta is one of two existing<br> 
    genera of the family Elephantidae. The name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of their molar teeth. Fossil remains of<br> 
    Loxodonta species have been excavated in Africa, dating to the Middle Pliocene.
