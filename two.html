    The Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant,<br> and native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. 
    In 2011, IUCN upgraded the conservation status of the Sumatran elephant<br> from endangered to critically endangered in its Red List as the population had declined 
    by at least 80% during the past <br>three generations, estimated to be about 75 years. The subspecies is preeminently threatened by habitat loss, degradation and 
    fragmentation,and poaching; over 69% of potential elephant habitat has been lost within the last 25 years. Much of the remaining forest cover is in blocks smaller
    than 250 km<sup>2</sup> (97 sq mi), which are too small to contain viable elephant populations.
